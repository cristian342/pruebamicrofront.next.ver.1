# Improvement Log

This log tracks lessons learned from past mistakes and provides directives to avoid repeating them.

## Directives:
- Always verify file existence before attempting to read or modify.
- Ensure all necessary documentation is updated *before* implementing code changes.
- Prioritize reviewing `refactoring_plan.md` at the start of every task until `refactoring_complete.md` exists.
