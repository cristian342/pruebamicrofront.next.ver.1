### Task: Fix TypeScript error in DocumentsPage.tsx

**Changes Made:**
- **File:** `src/microfrontends/documents/infrastructure/ui/pages/DocumentsPage.tsx`
- **Modification:** Corrected the import paths for `dayjs` plugins (`utc` and `timezone`) by appending `.js` to the module specifier. This resolves the TypeScript error "Cannot find module" by aligning with the project's module resolution strategy.

**Reasoning:**
The project is configured to use a module resolution that requires explicit file extensions in import statements for certain packages. The original imports were missing the `.js` extension, causing TypeScript to fail in locating the corresponding type declarations.
