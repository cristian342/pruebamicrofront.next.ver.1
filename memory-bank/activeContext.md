# Active Session Context

## Session Objective
- Fix the TypeScript error in `src/microfrontends/documents/infrastructure/ui/components/DocumentForm.tsx`.

## Changes Made
- **File Modified**: `src/main.tsx`
- **Modification**: Added an import for the `dayjs-timezone.d.ts` type definition file to ensure the TypeScript compiler recognizes the `dayjs.tz` extension. This resolves the error where the `tz` property was not found on the `dayjs` object.

## Next Steps
- Generate a commit message for the fix.
