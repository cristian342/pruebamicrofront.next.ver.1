# Progress Report

This document tracks the progress of the micro-frontend refactoring.

## Completed Tasks
- **Documentation**:
    - Created the Memory Bank structure (`manifest.md`, `project_overview.md`, `techContext.md`, `systemPatterns.md`).
    - Documented the `documents` and `document-types` micro-frontends.
- **Directory Structure**:
    - Created the `src/microfrontends/documents` and `src/microfrontends/document-types` directories.
    - Created the `src/shell` directory.
- **File Migration**:
    - Moved all files related to `documents` into `src/microfrontends/documents`.
    - Moved all files related to `document-types` into `src/microfrontends/document-types`.
- **Shell Refactoring**:
    - Refactored `App.tsx` to act as the application shell.
    - Cleaned up `main.tsx`.
- **Fix Imports**:
    - Updated all import paths in the moved files to reflect their new locations. All identified import errors have been resolved.
- **Cross-Microfrontend Communication**:
    - Implemented `DocumentTypeProvider` in `App.tsx` to share document types across micro-frontends.
    - Configured lazy loading for `DocumentsPage` and `DocumentTypeManagementPage` in `App.tsx`.
    - Updated `DocumentsPage.tsx` and `DocumentTypeManagementPage.tsx` to use default exports for compatibility with React.lazy.
- **Module Federation Plugin Fix**:
    - Resolved the "No se puede llamar a esta expresi√≥n" TypeScript error in `src/microfrontends/documents/vite.config.ts` by correctly calling the `federation` plugin using `federation.default`.

## Pending Tasks
- **Module Federation Setup**:
    - Continue configuring Vite/Webpack to use Module Federation to load the micro-frontends into the shell application. The import error for the `vite-plugin-federation` has been resolved.
- **Lazy Loading**:
    - Implement lazy loading for the micro-frontend components in the shell's routing. (This was partially done in the previous step, but the task refers to the overall strategy, which might involve more than just React.lazy).
- **Testing**:
    - Ensure the application works as expected after the refactoring.
- **Cleanup**:
    - Remove any empty or unused directories from the old structure.
