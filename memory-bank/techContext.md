# Technical Context

This document outlines the technical stack and architectural decisions for the project.

## Technology Stack
- **Framework**: React
- **Language**: TypeScript
- **State Management**: React Context API (initially), potentially migrating to a more robust solution if needed.
- **Styling**: To be determined (e.g., Material-UI, Styled Components).
- **Build Tool**: Vite

## Architecture
- **Micro-frontend Strategy**: Module Federation with Vite/Webpack. Each micro-frontend will be a self-contained application.
- **Shell Application**: A container application responsible for:
    - Rendering the main layout.
    - Routing between micro-frontends.
    - Managing shared state and dependencies.
- **Communication**: Custom Events or a shared library for cross-micro-frontend communication.
